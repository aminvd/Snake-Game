## User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to see and play the snake game for entertainment purposes. I also would like to have the game be more interactive by displaying certain information such as the current score so that I can compare my score with multiple trials.

Given: Snake Game data available 
When: The user starts/runs the Snake Game application 
Then: The window should load a working application of the snake moving. 

Example 2

When: The user uses the up, down, left, and right key arrows. 
Then: The snake should move according to the key arrow typed. 

Example 3

When: The user lets the snake eat the red apples. 
Then: The snake should grow and increase by one cell block. 

Example 4
